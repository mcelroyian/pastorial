Okay, attempting a "True Multi-Cell" 4x4 implementation for the Mill, while keeping a single interaction point and aiming for simplicity, is a significant but achievable goal. It will primarily involve changes to how the game understands and manages occupied space, and how the Mill draws itself.

Here's a plan outlining the steps to implement this:

**Plan for True 4x4 Multi-Cell Mill**

1.  **Introduce a Grid Occupancy Map:**
    *   **Purpose:** To centrally track which entity (if any) occupies each grid cell.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   This could be a 2D list (list of lists) initialized in your main game class, perhaps [`GameLoop`](src/core/game_loop.py). Let's call it `self.occupancy_grid`.
        *   The dimensions of `self.occupancy_grid` should correspond to your game world's grid dimensions (e.g., `config.GRID_WIDTH`, `config.GRID_HEIGHT` â€“ these might need to be defined in [`src/core/config.py`](src/core/config.py) if they aren't already).
        *   Each cell in `self.occupancy_grid[y][x]` would store `None` if empty, or a reference to the entity instance occupying that cell.
    *   **Helper Functions (Recommended in `GameLoop` or a new `GridManager` class):**
        *   `is_area_free(start_x, start_y, width, height)`: Checks the `occupancy_grid` to see if all cells in the given rectangle are `None`.
        *   `update_occupancy(entity, start_x, start_y, width, height, is_placing: bool)`: If `is_placing` is true, it marks the cells in the `occupancy_grid` with a reference to `entity`. If `is_placing` is false (i.e., entity is being removed), it sets them back to `None`.

2.  **Modify `Mill` Class ([`src/resources/mill.py`](src/resources/mill.py)):**
    *   **Add Size Attributes:**
        ```python
        class Mill(ProcessingStation):
            GRID_WIDTH = 4
            GRID_HEIGHT = 4
            # ...
            def __init__(self, position: pygame.Vector2):
                super().__init__(...)
                self.grid_width = Mill.GRID_WIDTH
                self.grid_height = Mill.GRID_HEIGHT
                # self.position will represent the top-left cell of the 4x4 area
        ```
    *   **Update `draw()` Method:**
        *   The total visual size of the mill will now be `self.grid_width * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE` by `self.grid_height * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE`.
        *   The `scale_factor` for rendering the SVG components needs to be adjusted. Instead of scaling to a single `config.GRID_CELL_SIZE`, it should scale to the new larger area. For example:
            ```python
            # In Mill.draw()
            # svg_viewbox_size = 200.0 (as before)
            target_render_width_pixels = self.grid_width * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE
            # Or, if you want to maintain aspect ratio based on height:
            # target_render_height_pixels = self.grid_height * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE
            # scale_factor = min(target_render_width_pixels / svg_viewbox_size, target_render_height_pixels / svg_viewbox_size)
            # For simplicity, let's assume square cells and scale to width:
            scale_factor = target_render_width_pixels / svg_viewbox_size
            ```
        *   All drawing coordinates will still be relative to `cell_x_start = self.position.x * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE` and `cell_y_start = self.position.y * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE`, which is the top-left corner of the 4x4 visual.
        *   **Text Overlays:** The positioning of text for input/output/progress needs to be re-evaluated. Instead of being relative to a single cell, they should be positioned logically within or around the new 4x4 visual. For example, `station_rect` for text positioning could be:
            ```python
            station_rect = pygame.Rect(
                cell_x_start, 
                cell_y_start, 
                self.grid_width * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE, 
                self.grid_height * config.GRID_CELL_SIZE
            )
            ```

3.  **Update Entity Placement Logic (Likely in [`src/core/game_loop.py`](src/core/game_loop.py)):**
    *   When spawning any entity, but especially a `Mill`:
        *   Determine its `entity_grid_width` and `entity_grid_height` (e.g., from `Mill.GRID_WIDTH` or default to 1 for other entities).
        *   Before creating the entity instance at `(gx, gy)`, call `self.is_area_free(gx, gy, entity_grid_width, entity_grid_height)`.
        *   If the area is free:
            *   Create the entity instance (e.g., `mill = Mill(pygame.Vector2(gx, gy))`).
            *   Call `self.update_occupancy(mill, gx, gy, mill.grid_width, mill.grid_height, is_placing=True)`.
            *   Add the mill to your list of game entities.
        *   If the area is not free, the placement fails (log an error, or try another spot, etc.).

4.  **Update Pathfinding Logic:**
    *   Pathfinding algorithms must now consult the `self.occupancy_grid`. Any cell `(x,y)` where `self.occupancy_grid[y][x]` is not `None` should be considered an obstacle.

5.  **Agent Interaction:**
    *   As per your request, agents will continue to target `mill_instance.position` (the top-left cell of the 4x4 area) for interactions like dropping off or picking up resources. This means the core logic for task targeting in [`src/tasks/task.py`](src/tasks/task.py) or [`src/agents/agent.py`](src/agents/agent.py) might not need to change significantly, as long as `mill_instance.position` is reachable (i.e., not blocked by another part of the mill itself in a naive pathfinder).

6.  **Entity Removal (Important for dynamic games):**
    *   If mills or other multi-cell entities can be removed from the game, you'll need a mechanism to clear their footprint in the `occupancy_grid`.
    *   When an entity is removed, call `self.update_occupancy(entity, entity.position.x, entity.position.y, entity.grid_width, entity.grid_height, is_placing=False)`.

**Simplifications Chosen:**

*   Single interaction point (top-left).
*   `Mill` stores its own grid dimensions. Other entities are assumed 1x1 unless also modified.
*   A central `occupancy_grid` in `GameLoop` is likely the simplest way to manage shared space information.

This is a substantial architectural change. It will touch several parts of your codebase. The most critical new piece is the `occupancy_grid` and the logic to check and update it during placement.
