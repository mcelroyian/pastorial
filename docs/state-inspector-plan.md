Okay, I can help you with a plan to implement the visual state overlays and provide notes for future improvements based on our discussion.

The core idea for the initial implementation is to **display key agent state information as text above each agent**, which can be toggled on and off.

## Plan for Implementing Visual State Overlays

This plan focuses on rendering text above each agent to show its current behavior and intent.

1.  **Objective**:
    * Display the agent's current behavior class name and a short description of its current intent (if any) as text above each agent.
    * This display should be toggleable via a keyboard shortcut.

2.  **Files to Modify**:
    * `input/handlers.py`: To register the toggle key.
    * `core/game_loop.py`: To manage the toggle state and pass it down.
    * `agents/manager.py`: To relay the toggle state to individual agents.
    * `agents/agent.py`: To implement the text rendering in the `draw` method.
    * `rendering/debug_display.py`: To ensure the debug font is accessible.
    * `core/config.py`: For text color.

3.  **Detailed Implementation Steps**:

    * **Step 1: Input Handling for Toggle**
        * In `input/handlers.py` (`process_events` function):
            * Add a new key to the `actions` dictionary, e.g., `actions['toggle_agent_debug_text'] = False`.
            * In the event loop, listen for a key press (e.g., `pygame.K_d`):
                ```python
                if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                    if event.key == pygame.K_t: # Existing
                        actions['toggle_panel'] = True
                    if event.key == pygame.K_d: # New for agent debug text
                        actions['toggle_agent_debug_text'] = True
                ```

    * **Step 2: Manage Toggle State in GameLoop**
        * In `core/game_loop.py` (`GameLoop` class `__init__`):
            * Add a new attribute: `self.show_agent_debug_text = False`.
            * Ensure `debug_display.init_debug_font()` is called if it's not already, or rely on its lazy initialization in `debug_display.display_fps`. For robustness, you can call it once here:
                ```python
                # In GameLoop __init__
                from src.rendering import debug_display
                debug_display.init_debug_font() # Ensure debug font is loaded once
                ```
        * In `core/game_loop.py` (`handle_input` method):
            * Add logic to toggle the new attribute:
                ```python
                if user_actions['toggle_agent_debug_text']:
                    self.show_agent_debug_text = not self.show_agent_debug_text
                ```
        * In `core/game_loop.py` (`render` method):
            * Pass the `self.show_agent_debug_text` flag to the agent manager's rendering method:
                ```python
                # In render method
                self.agent_manager.render_agents(self.screen, self.grid, self.show_agent_debug_text)
                ```

    * **Step 3: Pass Toggle State Through AgentManager**
        * In `agents/manager.py` (`AgentManager` class `render_agents` method):
            * Modify the method signature to accept the new flag:
                ```python
                def render_agents(self, screen: pygame.Surface, grid, show_debug_text: bool = False):
                ```
            * Pass this flag to each agent's `draw` method:
                ```python
                for agent in self.agents:
                    agent.draw(screen, grid, show_debug_text) # Pass the flag
                ```

    * **Step 4: Implement Text Rendering in Agent**
        * In `agents/agent.py` (`Agent` class `draw` method):
            * Modify the method signature:
                ```python
                def draw(self, screen: pygame.Surface, grid, show_debug_text: bool = False):
                ```
            * Import necessary modules at the top of `agents/agent.py`:
                ```python
                from ..rendering import debug_display # For the font
                # config is already imported
                ```
            * Inside the `draw` method, after drawing the agent's circle and inventory icon, add the following logic:
                ```python
                if show_debug_text and debug_display.debug_font:
                    debug_info_lines = []
                    # Behavior Text
                    behavior_name = self.current_behavior.__class__.__name__
                    if "Behavior" in behavior_name: # Shorten common suffix
                        behavior_name = behavior_name.replace("Behavior", "")
                    debug_info_lines.append(f"B: {behavior_name}")

                    # Intent Text
                    if self.current_intent:
                        intent_desc = self.current_intent.get_description()
                        max_len = 30  # Max length for intent description on screen
                        if len(intent_desc) > max_len:
                            intent_desc = intent_desc[:max_len-3] + "..."
                        debug_info_lines.append(f"I: {intent_desc}")
                    else:
                        debug_info_lines.append("I: None")
                    
                    # Optional: Agent short ID
                    # debug_info_lines.append(f"ID: {str(self.id)[:4]}")

                    line_height = debug_display.debug_font.get_height() + 1
                    for i, text_line in enumerate(debug_info_lines):
                        text_surface = debug_display.debug_font.render(text_line, True, self.config.DEBUG_TEXT_COLOR)
                        # Position text lines above the agent, stacked vertically
                        text_rect = text_surface.get_rect(centerx=screen_pos[0])
                        text_rect.bottom = screen_pos[1] - agent_radius - 5 - ( (len(debug_info_lines) - 1 - i) * line_height )
                        screen.blit(text_surface, text_rect)
                ```

This plan provides a straightforward way to get immediate visual feedback on agent states directly in the simulation.

## Notes for Next Improvements ðŸ’¡

Once the basic visual state overlay is implemented, you can progressively enhance your debugging capabilities. Here are some notes for improvements, keeping simplicity and impact in mind:

1.  **Click-to-Inspect Agent Details**:
    * **Concept**: Allow clicking on an agent to show a dedicated debug panel or overlay with more comprehensive information for that specific agent (e.g., full current intent, path, inventory details, recent errors).
    * **Benefit**: Reduces screen clutter from constant overlays while providing deep-dive capability when needed.

2.  **Visual Path and Target Drawing**:
    * **Concept**: When agent debug text is active (or via another toggle), draw the agent's current `current_path` (list of waypoints) on the grid. Highlight `target_position` and `final_destination`.
    * **Benefit**: Instantly see where an agent is going and diagnose pathfinding issues or stuck agents.

3.  **Agent History Trails**:
    * **Concept**: Store and draw the last N positions of an agent, perhaps color-coding the trail segments by the agent's behavior at that time.
    * **Benefit**: Helps understand agent movement patterns, oscillations, or if an agent frequently gets stuck in a particular area or state.

4.  **Task Link Visualization**:
    * **Concept**: Draw a subtle line from an agent to its key task-related entities (e.g., target resource node for `GatherAndDeliverTask`, or target `StoragePoint`/`Mill`).
    * **Benefit**: Makes it easier to understand what task an agent is performing and its current objective in the world.

5.  **Enhanced Occupancy Grid Visualization**:
    * **Concept**: Add a toggle to render the `Grid.occupancy_grid` directly, showing which cells are marked as occupied.
    * **Benefit**: Helps debug agent placement, pathfinding on occupied cells, and issues with entity placement logic.

6.  **Resource Node/Storage Point Debug Info**:
    * **Concept**: Similar to agent debug text, add toggleable text overlays for resource nodes (e.g., `claimed_by_task_id`) and storage points (e.g., `reservations`, `pickup_reservations`).
    * **Benefit**: Quick insight into resource states and reservation conflicts.

7.  **Improved Readability and Layout**:
    * **Concept**: Refine the positioning of debug text to avoid overlap, especially when many agents are close. Potentially use smaller fonts or contextually reduce information density.
    * **Benefit**: Makes the debug information more usable in dense scenarios.

Start with the plan for visual state overlays, as it provides a high "bang for your buck." Then, consider these improvements based on the specific debugging challenges you encounter. Good luck!
